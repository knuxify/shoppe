.SH NAME
shoppe \- manual page for shoppe 1.3.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shoppe
\fI\,function \/\fR[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
shoppe is a portable package manager that uses the system's native
package manager to suppliment packages that are not available in
shoppe's repositories. It can act as a frontend for most package
managers, and also works as a package manager itself.
.PP
It can serve as an alternative to projects like snap or flatpak,
as it allows packages to be installed on multiple distributions
without having to create separate packages for each distribution.
Unlike these projects, however, shoppe is not sandboxed,
and everything is installed natively.

More documentation is available at \fI\,/usr/share/doc/shoppe\/\fP.
