# shoppe

``shoppe`` (pronounciation: shop) is a bash-based package manager frontend and replacement. It works on any system with bash support.

Shoppe acts as two tools: a package manager frontend and package manager replacement. It offers its own package management tools while providing support for existing software.

Shoppe's main goal is to be as portable and clean as possible.

## Use cases

- Preparing multiple machines with one script, even without internet access
- Getting missing packages on certain distros
- Getting packages on embedded electronics (for example routers with open telnet access)
