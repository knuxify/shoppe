## About this branch

This is a clearer rewrite of the Shoppe package manager. It will also provide more documentation for the inner workings of the program.

Compatibility between older versions of shoppe and this rewrite will NOT be preserved. There are no plans for releasing any tools for upgrades.

You can read the documentation by browsing the docs folder. All documentation is written in the Markdown format.
