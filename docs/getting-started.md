# Getting started

The shoppe package manager was designed to be friendly both for end users and package maintainers.

This document will help you install and set up shoppe, and learn how to use it and how to add your own application.

## Installation

Installation steps are covered by the readme. Check the readme for more information.

## Setting up

Shoppe doesn't require any configuration and is ready to run out of the box. You can, however, create a configuration file and add some options to it *(See [[configuration]](docs/configuration.md))*.

## Using shoppe

To install a package, run ``shoppe install <packages>``. Shoppe will automatically detect if repositories are fetched and will fetch them for you.
